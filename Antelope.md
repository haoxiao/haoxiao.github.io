Reddit user [remizik][ref1] recently went on an adventure that made me foam at the mouth with jealousy. He decided to go inside Antelope Lower Canyon, which is located in Page, Arizona. He had been to Page from France once before, but he was unable to go inside. So now, returning in 2013, he was determined to do it.
What he discovered is beautiful, natural awesomeness.

		
		
				
This is the entrance. It’s obviously not for the claustrophobic.

As soon as you enter, you’re immediately blown away by the beauty.


![ref3][ref3]

The colors are gorgeous.


![ref4][ref4]

Absolutely gorgeous.

It was 9am and the sun was rising. That’s where this natural light is coming from.

The sun beaming inside is a sight you never forget.

“remizik” gave some advice to anyone who wants to check it out for themselves:
“This place is so peaceful.Note that it is the “LOWER” canyon. The upper is also very beautiful, but it was CROWDED with people. I enjoyed the lower a lot more. Advice for photographers: bring an tripod, chose your lens before going in, and stick with it. It’s very dusty in the canyon. Shoot raw if you can. If you can’t, go for the “cloudy” white balance, you’ll get nice colors!”

Officially adding this to my bucket list. What an incredible place.
